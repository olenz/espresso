# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_MPI_ONLY([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND[, MPI-WANTED-TEST]]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use MPI
#   (Message Passing Interface), a standard API for parallel process
#   communication (see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/)
