/** \page our_doxygen Writing the Developer's Guide (Doxygen)

The documentation for each function should contain a short
description, if necessary a more detailed description and a
description for the return value and parameters.
<p>
Look at the documentation of existing files and functions to get a
feeling how it should be!
<p>
Doxygen is able to understand simple LaTex and HTML commands as well
as some special command in order to give the documentation a nice
structure and to make it more readable. In the following list you find 
a short description of the most common commands we need:

<ul>
<li> \anchor doc_anchor   \verbatim \anchor <name> <description> \endverbatim
	Set an anchor to which you can refer using \ref doc_dref "\\ref"

<li> \anchor doc_href     \verbatim <a href="http://www.your_url.html"> name </a> \endverbatim
	Link to an external html source.

<li> \anchor doc_file     \verbatim \file <name> <description> \endverbatim
	Special anchor for a file (see \ref doc_anchor "\\anchor").

<li> \anchor doc_image    \verbatim \image html <image> \endverbatim
	Include a picture. The picture has to be in \c doc/figs/.
	<b>Do not use the HTML <tt>\<img\></tt> tag! The pictures will not be
	copied into the documentation!</b>

<li> \anchor doc_list 
\verbatim <ul>
<li> List entry
</ul> \endverbatim
	Creates a list in the documentation (For example the list you
	are reading at the moment).

<li> \anchor doc_name     
\verbatim /** \name <group_name> <short description>.
    <long_description>
*/
/*@{*/ 
<group members>
...
/*@}*/ 
\endverbatim
	Introduces a group to which one can refer with 
	\ref doc_dref "\\ref". The documentation of the group members
	must be inside the \@{ ... \@} comments.
<li> \anchor doc_param    \verbatim \param <parameter> <description> \endverbatim
	Documentation for a parameter of a function
<li> \anchor doc_dref      \verbatim \ref <name> ["<text>"] \endverbatim
	Inserts a link to the documentation of \<name\>.
<li> \anchor doc_return   \verbatim \return <description>\endverbatim
	Documentation for the return value of a function
<li> \anchor doc_todo     \verbatim \todo <task to be done> \endverbatim
	Adds an item to the \ref todo. The item on the list will be
	linked to the origin.
</ul>
