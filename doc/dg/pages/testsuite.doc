/** \page testsuite The Testsuite Directory

The scripts in the directory your_directory/Espresso/testsuite are
used to check wether changes in the program code affect basic
properties of ESPResSo. Before checking in any changes please make sure
that this test is succesfull. To run the test type <tt>gmake test</tt>
in the directory your_directory/Espresso. If you write any new
features for Espresso please provide new tests for them. 

This is a list of the tests that will be performed and a short
description what they test.

<ol>
<li> <b> lj.tcl </b><br>
     Tests Lennard-Jones potential: Energy, Pressure and Forces
<li> <b> madelung.tcl </b><br>
     Calculates the energy of a NaCl crystal. Test case for the
     electrostatic energy / force.

<li> <b> cell_model.tcl </b><br>
     This example shows the use of \ref tcl_constraint "constraints"
     and non periodic boundary conditions. It simulates a bundle of
     semiflexible polyelectrolyes with hydrophobic side chains
     neutralized by counterions in a spherical simulation cell.

<li> <b> diamond.tcl </b><br>
     This reproduces the data of S.Schneider/P.Linse, Eur.Phys.J.E <b>8</b>, 457-460 (2002):
     A diamond-shape network of 16 polyelectrolyte chains with 20 monomers each connected at 8 nodes is simulated for varying
     network packing fractions (densities) while the pressure is analysed (\ref tcl_analyze). 
     Similar to <i>kremerGrest.tcl</i> it additionally uses electrostatics including the auto-tuning feature (\ref tcl_inter).
